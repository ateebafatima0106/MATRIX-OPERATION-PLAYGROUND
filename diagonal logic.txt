Sure! Let’s break it down **step by step**.

---

### 1️⃣ The matrix `A`

```python
A = np.array([[5,0,0],
              [0,3,0],
              [0,0,8]])
```

This is a **3×3 square matrix**:

```
5 0 0
0 3 0
0 0 8
```

* The **diagonal elements** are: 5, 3, 8
* **All off-diagonal elements** are 0

We want to check if **all off-diagonal elements are 0**, i.e., if it’s a **diagonal matrix**.

---

### 2️⃣ `np.diag(np.diag(A))`

Step 1: `np.diag(A)`

* `np.diag(A)` extracts the diagonal elements of `A` into a **1D array**:

```python
np.diag(A)  # Output: [5 3 8]
```

Step 2: `np.diag(np.diag(A))`

* `np.diag([5,3,8])` reconstructs a **diagonal matrix**:

```python
np.diag(np.diag(A))
# Output:
# [[5 0 0]
#  [0 3 0]
#  [0 0 8]]
```

* Now we have a new matrix that has the **same diagonal as A**, but all off-diagonal elements are **forced to 0**.

---

### 3️⃣ Compare matrices

```python
A == np.diag(np.diag(A))
```

* This creates a **boolean array** element-wise: `True` if the element is the same, `False` otherwise.

```
[[ True  True  True ]
 [ True  True  True ]
 [ True  True  True ]]
```

* If all values are `True`, it means **A has zeros in all off-diagonal positions**, i.e., it’s diagonal.

---

### 4️⃣ `np.all()`

```python
np.all(A == np.diag(np.diag(A)))
```

* `np.all()` checks if **all values in the boolean array are True**.
* If yes → matrix is diagonal.
* If no → matrix is **not diagonal**.

---

### 5️⃣ Complete check

```python
if np.all(A == np.diag(np.diag(A))):
    print("Matrix is diagonal")
else:
    print("Matrix is not diagonal")
```

✅ This prints `"Matrix is diagonal"` for the example matrix above.

If you want, I can also **explain Method 2 using `np.eye`**, which is a bit more advanced but very handy.

Do you want me to explain that too?
